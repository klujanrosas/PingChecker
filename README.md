PingChecker
========
This is a project I made in like 10 mins or so , since I found myself in the need of checking the ping of 2 of my fav games against the servers I play on [Dota 2 US East](iad.valve.net), 
and [LOL LAN](104.160.136.3).

I've made terrible use of _async_ tasks to perform the test, since I needed to check not only once but an average reply delay between mi PC and their servers.

**The result may be different from what it's shown in-game, but with little margin**
